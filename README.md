# PairVAE

This repository contains the implementation of a novel machine learning workflow for linking and cross-reconstruction of characterization data from complementary structural characterization techniques called PairVAE on and open-access block copolymer morphology characterization dataset (complementary characterizations of Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of template-directed assembly of block copolymer morphologies) from Doerk. et al. Science Advances. 2023 Jan 13;9(2): eadd3687 as a proof-of-concept.
